Ensure CORS is enabled for the frontend domain.

Use .env to store all secret and database credentials.

JWT token should be stored in localStorage on the frontend and sent in the Authorization header.

##  Deployment

- **Backend**: Currently running on localhost during development.
               Ready for deployment to cloud platforms such as **AWS EC2**, **Render**,
               or **Railway** if needed.

- **Database**:  Hosted on **Railway (Cloud-based MySQL)** to meet the cloud hosting requirement.

          Note:  While the backend server is currently running locally,
                 the project is structured and ready to be deployed on any cloud platform.
                 Environment variables are managed via `.env` for easy deployment transition.
